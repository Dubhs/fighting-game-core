# Web Fighting Game Core

This is a web based fighting game that started as a fun idea i cooked up during thanksgiving,
its ended up feeling like a good base for distilling a more advanced fighter on top of pure js
so thats what im going to try and implement from here on out, the later features where rushed
and need some refactoring so i'll continue to work on it as i have time

## Setup
Im using browsersync server to develop and be able to see the code updated.
all you need is to:
* clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Dubhs/fighting-game-core.git`
* install browsersync from npm: `npm install browser-sync`
* then run it: `browser-sync --server -s --watch --no-notify --log-level debug`
and you'll have a server up and running to develop and test it.

## Help
if you need any help feel free to open an issue!
